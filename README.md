# TimeseriesFA

This a port to fastai v2 (dev) of Ignacio Oguiza's (https://forums.fast.ai/u/oguiza/summary) repository (https://github.com/timeseriesAI)

## A little reminder
timeseries is built using the fastai2 (fastai v2) which is built on top of Pytorch. fastai v2 is still under development.


## What is TimeseriesFA
Thanks to the new fastai v2 constructs, timeseries is a concise library that enables end-to-end deep learning training of time series in both classification, and regression problems. It uses InceptionTime Neural Network Architectures 

It is tested using the UCR datasets which is usually used to benchmark different NN architectures.
